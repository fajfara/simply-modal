# A simple modal library

## BIG NOTE
This is currently mainly used for my own development, also i am testing out how to publish packages on npm. 

How to use:

- If using build tools such as webpack, gulp, grunt etc. and using ES6, simply import SimplyModal ie.

```js
import SimplyModal from 'simply-modal';
```

- If You want to import the minified version, already built (works in ie11 and all modern browsers), you can find the built code in ./build/scripts/bundle.js.

- To develop, simply edit code in ./src and use guild to build the code. The file index.html has a very basic examples.
